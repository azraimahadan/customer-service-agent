# This is a placeholder for sample audio file
# In a real implementation, this would be a WAV audio file
# with customer voice saying something like:
# "My Unifi TV subscription shows 'No Service' and HDMI is plugged"

# To use real audio:
# 1. Replace this file with actual WAV audio recordings
# 2. Include various customer issue descriptions
# 3. Test different accents and speech patterns
