# This is a placeholder for a sample router image
# In a real implementation, this would be a JPEG image file
# showing a Unifi router with potential issues like:
# - "No Service" error message on screen
# - Unplugged cables
# - LED status indicators
# - Router model information

# To use real images:
# 1. Replace this file with actual router images
# 2. Include various scenarios: working router, error states, cable issues
# 3. Label images for Rekognition Custom Labels training
